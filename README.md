# Drink Counter

A Java program that complements my [digital-drinklist](https://github.com/Kesoo/digital-drinklist) project by summarising the output from the RFID-scanner in a readable way.

This Java program uses the `DRINKS.TXT` output file of the `Digital Drinklist` to generate a summary of all the logged drinks and present them in a readable way.
